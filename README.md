## My process

### Built with

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Vite
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project is much different from the other Frontend mentor projects that I have done. I have used Vite for development instead of CRA and it was a veru good experience, as it increased my local dev experience greatly. I was also supposed to make it dynamic and load daily/weekly/monthly data so I couldn't stick with plain HTML and CSS anymore. I integrated tailwind css within React and I must say, tailwind css is a really great tool.

### Continued development

This can be made into a full stack app and we can integrate real data from monitoring apps.
